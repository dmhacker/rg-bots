rg-bots
=======

***A collection of Python robots***

You can find them in use on [my profile](http://robotgame.net/user/8867).

These bots have been tested with the default rgkit simulator on my computer that pits chosen bots against each other.

NOTE: These robots are purely my ideas, and it would be awesome if you didn't take any code (without permission, that is).

I don't know why I like this game, but it's actually pretty addicting ...
