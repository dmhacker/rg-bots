***A collection of Python robots***

You can find them in use at: robotgame.net (profile = dmhacker)

These bots have been tested with a custom grid simulator on my computer that pits various bots against each other

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

___BOT HISTORY___ (from oldest to youngest):

  - ClusterBot: Original robot, targets finite point on grid and sends all units (to that point) for the rest of the game
  - Trident: Targets three points to attack on grid rather than one; fork of ClusterBot
  - Ponies: Units individually attack nearest enemy
  - Divident: Like Trident but can choose 3-6 random points to target and has better attack system
  - Kamek: Sends units after weakest in-game while being cautious about direct attacks
  - Pontiff: Excessive fleeing, abandoned
  - Sucidal: Fork of Pontiff that was miscoded but somehow turned out fairly good
  - Plat10: Short for Platoon 10; groups robots into clusters with self-evaluating directives + safe fleeing/attacking

NOTE: These robots are purely my ideas, and it would be awesome if you didn't take any code (without permission, that is).

I don't know why I like this game, but it's actually pretty addicting ...
