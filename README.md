***A collection of Python robots***

These bots have been tested with a custom grid simulator on my computer that pits various bots against each other

NOTE: These robots are purely my ideas, and it would be awesome if you didn't take any code (without permission, that is).

I don't know why I like this game, but it's actually pretty addicting ...
