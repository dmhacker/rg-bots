***A collection of Python robots***

You can find them in use at: http://robotgame.net/user/8867

These bots have been tested with a custom grid simulator on my computer that pits various bots against each other

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

___MY BOTS___ (from best to worst):

| Bot       | Strength (0-10)       |
| :------------- | :------------: |
| Marquis     | 7 |
| Plat10      | 6 |
| Divident | 5 |
| Ponies | 4 |
| Suicidal | 3.5 |
| Kamek | 3 |
| Trident | 3 |
| ClusterBot | 2 |
| Pontiff | 1.5 |

___PLANNED___:

| Bot       | Description       |
| :------------- | :------------: |
| Paragon     | Ultimate bot |
| Lexicon      | Short and sweet |
| Dizzzy | Moves randomly and attacks in circles |

NOTE: These robots are purely my ideas, and it would be awesome if you didn't take any code (without permission, that is).

I don't know why I like this game, but it's actually pretty addicting ...
