***A collection of Python robots***

You can find them being tested at: robotgame.net

BOT HISTORY (from oldest to youngest):

  - ClusterBot: Original robot, targets finite point on grid and sends all units (to that point) for the rest of the game
  - Trident: Targets three points to attack on grid rather than one; fork of ClusterBot
  - Ponies: Units individually attack nearest enemy
  - Divident: Like Trident but can choose 3-6 random points to target and has better attack system
  - Kamek: Sends units after weakest in-game while being cautious about direct attacks
  - Pontiff: IN DEV, can flee when necessary and attack enemies when advantageous
  - Sucidal: Fork of Pontiff that was miscoded but somehow turned out really good

NOTE: These robots are purely my ideas, and it would be awesome if you didn't take any code (without permission, that is).

I don't know why I like this game, but it's actually pretty addicting ...
